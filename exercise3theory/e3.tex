\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of the following operations on a binary tree, indicate
  its Big-Oh and Big-Omega complexity.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $search(v, T)$: find the node that contains value $v$ in a binary tree $T$
  \item $insert(v, T)$: insert value $v$ into binary tree $T$
  \item $delete(v, T)$: delete node with value $v$ from binary tree $T$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Suppose a binary tree is created by randomly inserting values
  $v_1, v_2, ..., v_N$ as follows: at each step the insert algorithm
  moves into the left subtree with probability 0.5 and into the right
  subtree with probability 0.5. On average, what is the complexity of:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $search(v, T)$?
  \item $insert(v, T)$?
  \item $delete(v, T)$?
  \end{enumerate}
\item For each of the following operations on a binary search tree (bst),
  indicate its Big-Oh and Big-Omega complexity.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $search(v, T)$: find the node that contains value $v$ in a bst $T$
  \item $insert(v, T)$: insert value $v$ into bst $T$
  \item $delete(v, T)$: delete node with value $v$ from bst $T$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Suppose a binary search tree is created by inserting values
  $1, 2, ..., N$ in a (uniformly) random order. On average, what is
  the complexity of:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $search(v, T)$?
  \item $insert(v, T)$?
  \item $delete(v, T)$?
  \end{enumerate}  
\end{enumerate}
